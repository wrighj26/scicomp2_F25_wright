Please make sure a copy of the completed assignment is placed in your private repos \"work\" directory and pushed to GitHub. Please label files _starting_ with the appropriate hw number. This week's will be `hw1_YOUR_NAME.ipynb`.\n",

The reason is that the _repo_ has the devcontainer instructions and when you open `VSCode` it recognizes this and starts up the devcontainer.  "

You should note that the means are different, but the medians (as it is a cumulative statistic) are the same. The mean is affected by the scale of the sample values, but the median only depends on the ordering of the samples. Monotonic transformations (like taking the log) do not change the ordering of samples."
