    "# Isochrones\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall that stellar clusters are gravitationally bound groupings of stars born at the same time.  By looking at the H-R diagram of a cluster -- specifically where the population _leaves_ the main sequence -- we can determine the age of the cluster.  To do this we must know the typical main sequence lifetime of stars, which depends on their mass, metalicity, etc. and for that we must turn to stellar modeling.  [MESA](https://docs.mesastar.org) is a stellar modeling library which incorporates the physics important for stellar evolution into 1-D models of stars.  The results useful for our purposes are stellar evolution tracks, the expected trajectory of the star through the H-R diagram as it evolves in time.\n",
    "\n",
    "[MIST](http://waps.cfa.harvard.edu/MIST/index.html) is an effort to supply a large database of MESA stellar track simulations for the purpose of producing isochrones.  If you imagine stacking up a cluster's worth of stellar evolution tracks, slicing through them at fixed age will produce an isochrone.\n",
    "\n",
    "I've used the [MIST isochrone interpolator](http://waps.cfa.harvard.edu/MIST/interp_isos.html) to produce several isochrones based on known properties of M4 (metalicity, reddening due to dust, etc.), which I've included in the `data/` directory."
